# React Fundamental Concepts Used:
- Functional Components: Building modular and reusable UI components.
- Hooks: Using useState, useEffect, and useContext for managing state, side effects, and context.
- Context API: For data management, cardContext and wishListContext allow centralized data access across components, improving state management.
- React Router: Navigation and dynamic routing with parameters using useParams and useNavigate.
- Conditional Rendering: Rendering specific UI elements based on state or conditions, like disabling the "Wishlist" button.

# Data Handling and Management:

- Context API: Youâ€™re using Context API to handle card and wishList states, which provides a clean way to access these states globally without prop drilling.
- Local Storage (if used): Persisting certain data across sessions to retain user preferences or selections.

# 5 Key Features of Your Project:

- Product Detail Display: Shows comprehensive details about each product, including price, specifications, and availability.
- Add to Cart and Wishlist: Allows users to add items to their cart and wishlist, with notifications on the addition and button disablement for already-wishlisted items.

- Rating System: Displays a star rating based on product ratings using ReactStars, providing a visual rating interface.
-  Category Filtering: Allows users to view products filtered by categories like Smartphones, Tablets, etc., to improve user experience.
-  Loading and Error Handling: Displays loading indicators and error messages to improve user experience during data fetching or unavailability of products.
