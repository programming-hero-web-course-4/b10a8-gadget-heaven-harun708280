# React Fundamental Concepts Used:
- Functional Components: Building modular and reusable UI components.
- Hooks: Using useState, useEffect, and useContext for managing state, side effects, and context.
- Context API: For data management, cardContext and wishListContext allow centralized data access across components, improving state management.
- React Router: Navigation and dynamic routing with parameters using useParams and useNavigate.
- Conditional Rendering: Rendering specific UI elements based on state or conditions, like disabling the "Wishlist" button.

# Data Handling and Management:

- Context API: You’re using Context API to handle card and wishList states, which provides a clean way to access these states globally without prop drilling.
- Local Storage (if used): Persisting certain data across sessions to retain user preferences or selections.
